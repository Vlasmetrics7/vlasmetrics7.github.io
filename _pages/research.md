## Research Areas

### Time-Series Econometrics and Long Memory

I work on non-stationary time series, long-memory models, and dynamic factor structures, with applications to macroeconomic and financial data, including high-frequency and panel settings.

### Climate, Energy and Macroeconomics

I analyze the effects of climate and energy variables (temperature, emissions, energy consumption) on economic growth, productivity and macro-financial risk, combining time-series methods with structural modeling.

### Financial Econometrics and Risk

My research includes volatility modeling, credit risk and CDS commonality, scenario analysis for economic growth under stress, and systemic risk quantification using multilevel factor structures.
