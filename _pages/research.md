## Research Interests
My research program develops a coherent econometric framework that links multilevel factor structures, fractional integration, long-memory dynamics, and stress-scenario propagation across macroeconomic, financial, energy, and climate-related systems. 
<br>
Across applications (from growth-in-stress densities to electricity markets, exchange-rate volatility, long economic histories, labour participation, pollution, and credit dynamics), most of my research papers uncover persistent common components, heterogeneous cross-sectional structures, and non-negligible tail risks that shape macroeconomic adjustment and policy design.
<br><br><br>
My research fields are:
<br>
- Non-stationary time series analysis  
- Modelling of persistence (long memory models)  
- Panel data models and dynamic factor models  
- Forecasting

## Research Areas

### Time-Series Econometrics and Long Memory

I work on non-stationary time series, long-memory models, and dynamic factor structures, with applications to macroeconomic and financial data, including high-frequency and panel settings.

### Climate, Energy and Macroeconomics

I analyze the effects of climate and energy variables (temperature, emissions, energy consumption) on economic growth, productivity and macro-financial risk, combining time-series methods with structural modeling.

### Financial Econometrics and Risk

My research includes volatility modeling, credit risk and CDS commonality, scenario analysis for economic growth under stress, and systemic risk quantification using multilevel factor structures.
